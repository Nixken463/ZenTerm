This project is for increasing my knowledge of python and getting better at coding. For my other projects I relied heavily on ai and in turn didn't learn as much as I had hoped so this time
I tried using ai only for explaining things I don't understand and not just copy its code.


# DISCLAIMER: This project is very early in development, it's not recommended for use yet since there can be a lot of issues.
